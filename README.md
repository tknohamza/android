### <a name="How Android Works"></a> How Android Works

Android operates on a multi-layered architecture, including:

1. Linux Kernel – Provides core system services such as security, memory management, and hardware abstraction.  
2. Hardware Abstraction Layer (HAL) – Interfaces between the kernel and hardware-specific components.  
3. Android Runtime (ART) – Executes applications using ahead-of-time (AOT) and just-in-time (JIT) compilation.  
4. Native Libraries – Include essential components like SQLite, WebKit, and OpenGL.  
5. Application Framework – Offers high-level services for activity management, notifications, and content providers.  
6. Applications – User-installed or system apps built with Java, Kotlin, or C++ using Android SDK.
